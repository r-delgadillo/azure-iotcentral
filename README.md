## Service Principal

To create a service principal, follow the
[Azure AD guide to create a Application Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#create-an-active-directory-application).
The application type should be Web app / API and the sign-on URL value is
irrelevant (you can set any value).
